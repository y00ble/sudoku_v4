Bifurcation as a tree, only need to remember bifurcations at the current level
Contradictions as a graph (adjacency matrix?) for easy removal after finalisations

Constraints that can act freely on the board
    - At the start, adding coverees
    - In the middle, editing possibles

Detection of pairs/triples??
